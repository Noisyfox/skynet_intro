Which file in pastebot.net should be signed? hello.fbi
Signed file written to pastebot.net/hello.fbi.signed
smerity@pegasus:~/usyd/elec5616_proj/framework_part2$ python3.2 bot.py
Listening on port 1337
Waiting for connection...
Enter command: download hello.fbi
The file has not been signed by the botnet master

Enter command: list
Files stored by this bot: hello.fbi.signed
Valuables stored by this bot: []
Enter command: exit

Notice: 'Test' and 'exit' are sent and received as the same encrypted message.
This means it's vulnerable to frequency analysis. When 'a' is sent multiple times,
it ends up "looping" as we're using a simple repeated XOR cypher.
This is something that should be fixed.
